# Shade Streams — Private Nanopayments for Agents on Arc

> **Pay by the fraction. Settle the net. Reveal nothing.**
>
> An AI agent consumes a paid service and pays **per request** — value as small
> as a fraction of a cent — by signing tiny **vouchers off-chain**. Only the
> **private net** settles on-chain, in **USDC on Arc**, funded **cross-chain via
> Circle CCTP**. Built on a zero-knowledge shielded pool, so the individual
> payments are invisible and only an auditable receipt is revealed.

## The 60-second version

For as long as a payment couldn't be smaller than ~30¢ after fees, you couldn't
sell a one-cent play or charge an agent per API call — you had to bundle a month
and charge $10. **Nanopayments remove the floor.** But a transparent per-call
loop leaks every payment. Shade Streams gives you both: **sub-cent, per-call
payments that are also private**, settled on Arc in USDC.

Two rails, one story:

```
BASE RAIL — StreamPay.sol      real native USDC per second, on-chain meter
                               open (fund cap) · pause/resume · withdraw · stop-with-refund
                               continuous authorization of a RATE, not a signature per tick

PRIVACY LAYER — shielded stream  vouchers off-chain, one ZK proof to settle the private NET
                                 (composes on top of the base rail — hides per-tick detail)
```

```
OPEN     agent locks a spending cap into a channel (real USDC — or private via the ZK layer)
STREAM   the on-chain meter accrues per second in real USDC; vouchers off-chain add privacy
SETTLE   service withdraws / stops (base) or submits the highest voucher (privacy)
RECLAIM  the agent is refunded the unspent tail — no funds can be stranded
```

The USDC backing the channel is bridged in from another chain (Base / Arbitrum)
via **Circle CCTP** — so an agent pays for an Arc service with funds from
anywhere.

## It runs live on Arc testnet

Not a mock — deployed and settled on **real Arc testnet** (chainId 5042002).

### Base rail — real per-second USDC (`StreamPay`)
Contract [`0x469305823f9796f973363F48a508a47309B2D92c`](https://testnet.arcscan.app/address/0x469305823f9796f973363F48a508a47309B2D92c).
Payer `0x20D3…1796`, payee (distinct address) `0xdAE1…9970`. Cap 0.005 USDC at
$0.0001/sec, value-conservation invariant asserted on-chain from `Withdrawn` +
`Stopped` events (`payee_paid + payer_refund == deposit`).

| Step | Real tx (on [arcscan](https://testnet.arcscan.app)) |
|------|------|
| Open — fund 0.005 USDC as `msg.value` | [`0x8ec9165f…`](https://testnet.arcscan.app/tx/0x8ec9165f7c8c2ff701e35dfb19fed2db315b9369b12f28483790dbd7a9634412) |
| Withdraw — mid-stream 0.0011 USDC → service | [`0xf1eb8d0f…`](https://testnet.arcscan.app/tx/0xf1eb8d0f8dbdb583c03ccfafe2ef69d9d611a220e4641885ff382c7cc4fb1e89) |
| Pause · Resume · Stop | [`0x8070…`](https://testnet.arcscan.app/tx/0x8070d5f938e8c97ee44176e4bf57ef1f53b2182be9f86b1a27d21b2585fef849) · [`0x9003…`](https://testnet.arcscan.app/tx/0x9003736530439cc13a76c9eb6bf9d4123eb7bd548ade015a6f9667b1f93423f0) · [`0x8ebc…`](https://testnet.arcscan.app/tx/0x8ebc27ad2771e8e94f8829216cdc3facfcdf9c0631c1b89516110cb1bf17ee5b) |
| Stop paid: 0.0013 USDC → service, 0.0026 USDC refunded to agent | (from `Stopped` event) |

Total streamed to the service address: **0.0024 USDC** over the run, verifiable
on arcscan. Full run log: see [docs/E2E_REAL_WORKFLOW.md](docs/E2E_REAL_WORKFLOW.md).

### Privacy layer — shielded net (`agent-service`)
Both ZK proofs verified on-chain by **Arc's BN254 pairing precompiles**:

| What | Transaction (on [arcscan](https://testnet.arcscan.app)) |
|------|------|
| Open a payment channel (ZK proof) | `0x6e87f408…` — block 50,297,330 |
| Settle 100 requests' net (ZK proof) | `0xec66753c…` — block 50,297,357 |

### Cross-chain funding — real USDC via Circle CCTP

| What | Chain | Transaction |
|------|-------|------|
| Burn 5 USDC | Base Sepolia | [`0x1d8cb919…`](https://sepolia.basescan.org/tx/0x1d8cb9197aaca35e446e5662948a6dbf730ec9312f6e6ad90ba848732c1103e0) |
| Mint ~4.995 USDC | Arc testnet | [`0x8b7af5e6…`](https://testnet.arcscan.app/tx/0x8b7af5e6dce891ba8a6aaf571b589b525fb49a17858e51921bf8806c2c7e8857) |

## See it yourself

```bash
npm install
cd contracts/arc && forge build && cd ../..
npm run circuits:build:arc && npx tsx scripts/sync-arc-verifiers.ts

# the base real-USDC rail: agent streams real native USDC at ~$0.0001/sec on Arc,
# pauses, resumes, withdraws mid-stream, then stops with refund — every step
# settled on-chain in real value, with real tx hashes on arcscan:
npm run streampay-demo             # local anvil (real EVM)
npm run streampay-demo:arc         # REAL Arc testnet (real USDC, real hashes)

# the privacy layer on top: agent buys a service across 100 metered requests
# via ZK-shielded vouchers, then settles the private net with one proof:
npm run agent-service-demo         # local anvil (no funds needed)
npm run agent-service-demo:arc     # live on real Arc testnet
REQUESTS=1000 npm run agent-service-demo:arc     # scale to 1000 requests

# the literal cross-chain leg: burn USDC on Base Sepolia, mint on Arc via CCTP:
BASE_SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY=0x…  npm run cctp-bridge:arc
```

`streampay-demo` is the honest base rail: real native USDC moves on-chain by the
second at a sub-cent rate, with pause / resume / mid-stream withdraw / stop-and-
refund, and a value-conservation invariant checked at the end (payee-paid +
payer-refund == deposit). `agent-service-demo` sits on top: it prints, per
request, the **prompt** the agent sent, the **payment** it authorized, and the
**service's response** — then one shielded settlement for the whole session.

---

## How it works

A **unidirectional payment channel anchored to a shielded note**:

- **Vouchers are just signatures.** Each per-call payment is an EdDSA-Poseidon
  signature over `{channelId, cumulative, seq}`. The agent signs, the service
  verifies — no chain, no gas. Millions of ticks cost nothing.
- **The settle proof verifies the voucher in-circuit.** `stream_settle` runs
  circomlib's `EdDSAPoseidonVerifier` on the payer's signature and bounds
  `cumulative ≤ cap`, so the service can never settle more than the agent
  signed, and value is conserved (`payee + refund == cap`).
- **Notes live in a shared shielded pool.** Open/settle/reclaim mint ordinary
  shielded notes into `ShieldedPool`'s O(log n) Merkle tree; recipients spend
  them later through the normal withdraw/transfer paths.
- **The channel is consumed exactly once** — either settle or reclaim, never
  both — and the agent's input note nullifier is burned so it can't be reused.

The **8 named safety invariants** (cap bound, forged-voucher rejection, value
conservation, spend-once, timeout-reclaim, ASP-eligibility, receipt integrity)
are each covered by a specific test — see `docs/SHADE_STREAMS_STATUS.md`.

## Architecture

| Layer | Where | Role |
|-------|-------|------|
| BN254 circuits | `circuits/*_bn254/`, `circuits/lib_bn254/` | commitment + Merkle membership, in-circuit EdDSA voucher, value conservation |
| Proving library | `packages/proving/src/bn254/` | TS-native witness + Groth16 proof → native `uint256[]` calldata (no Rust, no byte-packer) |
| Contracts | `contracts/arc/src/` | `ShieldedPool`, `StreamEscrow`, `NullifierRegistry`, `IncrementalMerkleTree`, 7 verifiers |
| Voucher SDK + agents | `packages/sdk/src/{streams,agents,receipts}.ts` | sign/verify vouchers, `PayerAgent`/`PayeeAgent`, receipts |
| Chain client + CCTP | `packages/arc-actions/` | ethers calls, CCTP config + real bridge |
| x402 + relayer | `apps/api/src/x402.ts`, `apps/relayer/src/stream-relayer.ts` | service gating + batched settlement |

Everything security-critical is **on-chain**: proof verification (BN254
precompiles), nullifier spend-once, value conservation, Merkle append. The
backend never sees a note secret or a private key.

## Honest status

**Real & verified on-chain:** the BN254 ZK layer, every settlement path
(deposit/withdraw/transfer/MPC/RFQ/CCTP-exit), the streaming payment channel
(open/stream/settle/reclaim/batch), x402 gating, the agent layer, receipts,
deployment on real Arc testnet, and a real cross-chain CCTP transfer.
**210+ automated checks pass.**

**Documented seams (external infra, not code gaps):** Circle Gateway gasless
batching (needs Gateway endpoints), using the actual CCTP-minted Arc USDC in the
pool (a config change vs. the demo's mock token), and deny-set compliance (needs
the exclusion circuit). Each is called out where it lives.

> **Testnet only. Not audited. Do not use with real funds.** This is a
> hackathon build demonstrating a working private-nanopayments stack on Arc.
